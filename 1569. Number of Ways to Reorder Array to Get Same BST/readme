We only see the permutations in the left subtree as when the positions for elements in the left subtree are selected, the elements in the right subtree have to occupy the 
remaining positions in one way only so as to maintain their relative positions.eg
[5,4,3,7,8]
so left subtree has [4,3]
and right subtree has [7,8]

so for left subtree elements we can pick 2C4 permutations as we are selecting 2 out to 4 positions. 
So the right subtree elements can occupy the remaining positions in only one way as 7 has to come before 8 to have the same BST
